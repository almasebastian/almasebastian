# 👋 Hi, I'm [Your Name]!

I'm a PhD student in **astronomy and astrophysics** passionate about exploring the universe through code, data analysis, and open science. My research focuses on chemical enrichment of the early Universe, high redshift galaxies and quasars and the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) through the techniques of high-redshift quasar spectroscopy and imaging spectroscopy of deep quasar fields. I enjoy collaborating on scientific software, visualizing data, and leveraging the use of statistical toolsfor data interpretation to uncover new insights about the cosmos. I also aim to gain some experience on applying machine learning to large volumes of astronomical data. I have been part of two ESO Large Programs: E-XQR-30 and REQUIEM.
